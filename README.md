## About
This is my solution for the challenge of building a Stat Preview Card component from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

The goal of the challenge is to re-create the layout of a card component on different viewport widths. On smaller screens the elements of the card components stack on top of one another. On larger screens, the card has two columns. The first column is for the heading, description, and other infos. The second column is for a big hero image.

There are no interactive elements for this challenge.

**Any feedback on how to improve my solution would be greatly appreciated**. ðŸ˜Š

## User Stories

## Built With
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Sass

## Usage
You can download the project files by clicking on the green **Code** button,  then select **Download Zip**.

Once you finish extracting, move into the project folder, open the terminal, and type the following code:

```npm install```

This will install all the required dependencies.

To compile Sass into CSS and watch for any future changes, type the following code in your terminal:
