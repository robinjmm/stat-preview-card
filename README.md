## About
This is my solution for the challenge of building a Stat Preview Card component from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

The goal of the challenge is to re-create the layout of a card component on different viewport widths. On smaller screens the elements of the card components stack on top of one another. On larger screens, the card has two columns. The first column is for the heading, description, and other infos. The second column is for a big hero image.

There are no interactive elements for this challenge.

## User Stories
The user should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## Built With
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Sass
- PostCSS

## Usage
You can download the project files by clicking on the green **Code** button,  then select **Download Zip**.

Once you finish extracting, move into the project folder, open the terminal, and run the following code while in the project directory:

```npm install```

This will install all the required dependencies.

To compile Sass into CSS and watch for any future changes, run the following code:

```npm run sass```

To continue watching changes in Sass files and automatically reload the browser, run the following code:

```npm run sass:serve```

To compile Sass into a minified version of CSS, run the following code:

```npm run prod```
